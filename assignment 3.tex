\section*{Question : }
The blood groups of 30 students of class VIII are recorded as follows :

\begin{center}
A,B,O,O,AB,O,A,O,B,A,O,B,A,O,O,\\
A,AB,O,A,A,O,O,AB,B,A,O,B,A,B,O
\end{center}

\noindent Represent this data in the form of a frequency distribution table. Which is the most common, and which is the rarest, blood group among these students? 
\section*{Solution : }
\begin{table}[ht!]
\input{tables/table-1.tex}
\centering
\caption{}
\label{table:table 1}
\end{table}
\noindent From the above table blood group \textbf{O} has the maximum frequency. So \textbf{O} is the most common blood group. Also blood group \textbf{AB} has the least frequency. So \textbf{AB} is the rarest blood group.\\
